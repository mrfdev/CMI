{#gold}/skyblock greenhouse help (information, read ALL pages!)

{#Feijoa}A greenhouse lets you have a mini greenhouse biome right on your skyblock island. Each type of greenhouse will behave differently. 
&r
{#Feijoa}Some will erode over time and change blocks to get new blocks. Others will spawn mobs specific to that biome type. Some will grow plants available in those biomes. Some are a combination of all.
&r
{#Feijoa}You can type: {#orange}/skyblock greenhouse{#Feijoa}, to open the GUI menu and pick the one you want. It will also show you what is required in order for it to be recognized.

{#Feijoa}To build a greenhouse, make a medium sized glass block rectangle with a flat glass roof. Put the required blocks, items, water or lava on the inside. And sometimes if it doesn't work, you need a bit more or less. 
&r
{#Feijoa}Next, place a hopper inside the wall, not in the ground, below it, or above it. 
&r
{#Feijoa}Next, place a door inside the wall, no in front of it, or the block behind the glass, inside the wall. 
&r
{#Feijoa}Now, it's time to get the greenhouse detected, I will show you how.

{#Feijoa}GO &lINSIDE&r{#Feijoa} the greenhouse and type: {#orange}/skyblock greenhouse{#Feijoa}, and click on the one you wanted, it will try to recognize it and activate it. 
&r
{#Feijoa}The top right diamond might show more greenhouses you can buy / unlock. 
{#Feijoa}You can use {#orange}/skyblock greenhouse remove{#Feijoa}, while standing inside of it, to remove that one and perhaps start over or try another design.
