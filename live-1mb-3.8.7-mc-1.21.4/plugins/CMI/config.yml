  # If you don't want to deny empty warp command but want to deny any extra variable after that, then just add space, in example 'warp :5:false'
  # When setting warmups for CMI commands, use full command name and not allias, in example 'cmi warp:5:false'
  # Administration can bypass limitations with cmi.warmupbypass.[commandname] permission node
  # ATTENTION! cmi home command is being handled in special way and to prevent double warmup, add space, example: - cmi home :5:false

  # - cmi warp :3:false:GlyphHead
