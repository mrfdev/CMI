# Commands performed on particular event
# Full color code support and some variables
# If command starts with msg! and then player name is given, simple message will be sent to that player if he is online.
# If command starts with broadcast! then message will be sent to everyone on server in simple manear
# If command starts with actionbar! then all players will get action bar message defined after this variable
# If command starts with title! then all players will get title message defined after this variable
# If command starts with subtitle! then all players will get subtitle message defined after this variable
# If command starts with kickall! then all players will be kicked from server with defined message. Usefull before server stop.
# If command starts with perm:[permissionNode]! then command will get performed if player has permission node. This will not work when we dont know who is target player. In example: perm:cmi.announce.vip! broadcast! Hello vip guys
# [playerName] to insert target player name
# [playerDisplayName] to insert player display name
# [lvl] to insert player level
# [exp] to insert player total exp
# [hp] to insert player health
# [maxHp] to insert player max health
# [hunger] to insert player hunger level
# [gameMode] to insert player gamemode
# Keep in mind that joinServer commands will not be performd on firstJoinServer event

# ATTENTION!
# Extreme usage of heavy commands could result in increased load for your server. Try using as little of them as possible for one event
# and if possible spread them out with a delay by using "delay! 0.3" or similar variable
# This will allow server to catch up with his calculation instead of forcing him to do all of those commands at once
