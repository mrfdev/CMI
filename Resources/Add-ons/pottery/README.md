A little CustomAlias addon that adds the /pottery command for staff members to use. Making it a little easier to quickly give someone a decorative pottery item with a combination of any of the patterns on the four sides.

The purpose of this little add-on is to demonstrate how some of the CMI features can be used to achieve something to bring convinience to your server. In this example we use the pottery, but you can imagine extending this to goathorns, paintings, buckets, disks, etc.

Okay, **let's get started**. Thank you for being interested in this little add-on.

Make sure CMI and CMILib are on the latest versions - this is made with CMI 9.6.x and CMILib 1.4.x in mind, for Minecraft 1.20.x

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Download Instructions

- Get the [1MB-cmi-pottery-command.yml](/Resources/Add-ons/goathorn/1MB-cmi-pottery-command.yml) file and put it inside the `~/plugins/CMI/CustomAlias/` directory.

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Installation Instructions

- After download, reload CMI with `/cmi reload`

- Note that the command technically works, but it will be red and won't suggest tab-completion. You'd have to /stop and start the server to properly register commands.

- Permissions: `cmi.customalias.pottery` is the permission node that's required to use this command.

And that's it.
