# Temporary CMI command: /vulcan to help mitigate those trying to exploit the bug in anti cheat plugin vulcan
# You can change this to whatever you need it to do, of course, but right now, it tells online staff what to do, and kicks the player out. 
# Version 0.0.1, build 001, Discord.gg/floris
# Note: I use VU1C4N as kick string so I can later zgrep -n "VU1C4N" *.gz in the server /logs/
