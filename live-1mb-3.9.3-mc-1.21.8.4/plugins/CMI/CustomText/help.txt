{#Cerulean} -{#Geyser} Once you join for the first time, you can type /newplayer to get started, or /rtp to randomly teleport to our /wild world. By the way, each world-name is also a command, such as: /spawn, /wild, /skyblock.
&r
{#Cerulean} -{#Geyser} You can use /sethome base, to set a home called base. Then at any time you can use /home base to teleport back. 
&r
{#Cerulean} -{#Geyser} Okay, you can always switch game type, but we have regular survival in the /wild world, where you can use /end and /nether as commands to switch dimension. Other game types do not have these dimensions available. 
&r
{#Cerulean} -{#Geyser} Other game types are /acid, /cave, /skygrid, /oneblock and /skyblock. Inventories do not share between gametypes. 
&r
{#Cerulean} On the following pages from this help, we will walk you through the features that we have, and how to get more indepth help on each of them. But most features can be accessed through the /menu command.
