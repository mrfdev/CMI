 Welcome to 1MB Horses!

 Find a wild horse, and then tame it normally.
 The game will tell you when it's ready to claim.

 Then, while still riding it, type:
 /horse claim <name>
 (you can rename your horse later)

 There's more! Click on Next:

 Once you own a horse, you can give it 
 to another player, rename it, stable it,
 set it free, kill it, revive it, etc.

 You can even sell your horse, or buy
 a horse from another player. 

 The next page lists all the commands.
