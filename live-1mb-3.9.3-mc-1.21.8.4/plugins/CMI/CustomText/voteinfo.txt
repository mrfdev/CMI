Thank you for supporting the 1MoreBlock.com server by playing. 

Please consider voting for the server. In return we can give you some things.

This book will give you a lot of info about our Voting features.
<NextPage>
Voting will give you some stuff, including Vote tokens. They are special and you can trade 64 of them for special items.

Which items, and how this works is explained on this page:

<NextPage>
Some ways to support us is by being an active player. 

We can rank you up over time for this. 

Another way is to get the word out and invite friends, or say on social media where you're playing. 
<NextPage>
Voting for the server tells others that it's a fun place to play.

Donating for the server is also possible. That also helps us to keep going. 

Anyway, this is about voting, so let's talk about that.
<NextPage>
Each time you vote we say thank you by giving some in-game money, jobs points, welcome points, exp levels, diamonds, and vote tokens. 

You can use the jobs points in the /jobs shop, the /money in our global /market or when using /trade for items with other users.
<NextPage>
Welcome /points can be used to buy some instant items or perks. /exp levels to enchant your resources or rename them. 

Diamonds and other reources for /sell or /craft, or just to collect.
<NextPage>
And Vote Tokens are unique to our server, and special. They can give you /money at /warp vote, or they can be collected to display in item frames, to trade with others, sell on /market for a lot, maybe every 16 can be traded at /warp vote for 64,000 /money. 
<NextPage>
But most interestingly for most: 64 vote tokens of the same type can be exchanged against a special item, command, tool, weapon, action, perk, etc. 

Something that's otherwise not easily possible.
<NextPage>
If you vote for the server seven days in a row you get trade or exchange vote tokens, these can be used to exchange 3 of one type for 3 of another type of vote token. 

This is also done at /warp vote at the exchange table.
<NextPage>
There's also a trade table at /warp vote where you can trade old or unstackable tokens for the latest version of the tokens.
