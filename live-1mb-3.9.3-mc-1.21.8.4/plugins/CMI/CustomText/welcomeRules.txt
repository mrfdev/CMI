Nice to meet you %cmi_user_name%, 

We are a family-friendly community. We accept players over the age of 13 from all around the world.

We also do not tolerate grief, toxic behavior, and other obvious things such as mods that give an unfair advantage. 

For a quick list of our /rules, which we will assume you have read before playing, please type: /rules

If you worry about any of our rules, feel free to reach out to existing players or staff members and ask them :) We're here to help.

Have fun! 

And thank you for respecting our community guidelines.
