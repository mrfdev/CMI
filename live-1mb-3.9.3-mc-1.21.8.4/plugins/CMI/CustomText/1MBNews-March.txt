{#darkred}&lGiant Dig Site Plans Revealed!
&r
The 1MoreBlock.com community came together for a huge dig project, gaining many mcMMO levels, wealth, and friends!

_dj3d_ commented, &o"It was a great way to get a bunch of resources as a new player and meet folks."
&r
From every painstaking deepslate to moss conversion to the many deaths that ensued, this project was no easy task! 
<NextPage>
Layer by layer, players and staff chipped away until this hole was completely dug out! 

This dig indeed provided a prodigious amount of blocks and items, as well as job leveling and camaraderie, while slowly stripping away the landscape

to reveal a deep dark secret that lay in wait.

1MoreEgg, teamed with gorodorith, stated, &o"I'd say it was very satisfying, how the layers disappeared one by one, it was very nice to see!"

BeastsongAmbles added, &o"It was a staggering undertaking, and the process was amazing to behold! Bringing light to the deepest darkness was a mighty goal!"
&r
Gorodorith, the owner of the hole, said, &o"I didn't really have a plan... 
<NextPage>
&obut now I want to improve on the ancient city we uncovered."&r

We can't wait to see what these improvements will entail and how the changes to the ancient city (that was discovered deep within) will set this project apart from others here on 1MB.

Staff member, yakirarage stated, &o"It was actually pretty fun to work together with other players again on a bigger project. It's so nice to come together as a community. And it's nice to see how both players and staff worked together to cut the time down to dig this hole."

Many of the excavation crew commented not knowing what the plan was for this giant evenly dug out pit, but continued to offer aid day after day. This project has been a great way for everyone to come together, even if most were unaware of what that goal was.

As mrfloris stated in an interview, &o"It's pretty nifty to see that this is indeed a community here on 1MB and not just greedy PvP players trying to steal items. I even made a one-hour video of just me mining away some stone."

We would have to agree, mrfloris. Seeing players, new and old, work on something so grand for the sake of just helping out, is an amazing thing to witness here on the server. We hope to see more of this camaraderie in the future as many new citizens join our ranks!
