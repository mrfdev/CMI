Hi {#magenta}%cmi_user_name%&r, these are the helpful instructions to guide you and your team members to start your own team on your own island. Please note that this example uses /oneblock, but this works on /skyblock, /skygrid, /acid, and /cave. You cannot team up however in the Survival worlds end/nether/general.

Press &6&lNext&r below, to learn the first step. \n

Great job, okay, the first step is that both you and your future team member have to be in the /oneblock world. To get there you can type: &6&l/oneblock&r

Checking... You are in this world right now: %player_world%, I don't know about your friend. (Press &lTAB&r key to check who is in what world)

If you are sure you and your friend are both in the oneblock world then click on &6&lNext&r below, to learn how to invite someone to your team. \n

Okay {#magenta}%cmi_user_name%&r let's explain how that works. First, you have to pick to be the owner of the oneblock island. If that is you, then as owner you have to invite your friend to the team. But, realise when they have a oneblock island, they will lose their island, and won't get it back. You are all on one island together. If you all want to use the island of your friend, they have to be the owner.

Alright, let's go! To invite someone as owner to join the team, type: &6&l/oneblock team invite PLAYERNAME&r (of course, replace playername with the name of the person you are inviting).

Now, click on &6&lNext&r below to learn how to accept an invite and join a team.\n

&r \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n {#orient}•--{#cerulean}❖ 1MB Teams ❖{#orient}-----------------------•
The owner has just invited a friend to join their team. It's now time for that friend to accept this invitation. They can do that by typing this twice: &6&l/oneblock team accept

As always, you two should both read carefully what's on the screen. So you don't miss any instructions or important information. 

&lHave fun gaming together!
