<T>{#Cerulean}Community Guidelines (/rules)&r</T>

We are a family-friendly community, we do not tolerate toxic players, we tend to perm-ban without option to appeal when people cheat, play unfair, etc. We welcome friendly players with a smile on their face who play fair and enjoy playing the survival game of Minecraft. Our community has an age requirement of 13+. 

We invite you to please read our community guidelines, /rules

<T>{#Cerulean}Global Market&r</T>

We have an economy on the server, you can earn money through Jobs, fishing, trading with players, etc. The money will show in your /balance, and you can /pay other users, as well as sell and buy items from the global market. Type /ah or /market to open up that window and see what's available. 

To sell something you can hold the item(s) in your hand and type /market sell amount, for example you can hold 5 wood planks and type /market sell 5, it will put it up on the market for others to buy. When they do, you get 5 added to your /balance. 

If nobody buys your items, they will be returned to you. You can cancel your items at any time.

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}Bedrock Pickaxe&r</T>

You cannot break the bedrock that makes up world borders, such as -64. But if you have misplaced a bedrock that you obtained through an event or drop party, or maybe someone gifted one to you or you bought one from the /market, you can go to /jobs shop, and use your Jobs points to buy the special bedrock pickaxe. Be careful, it breaks easily. You can use it a few times, since bedrock is so tough. 

You can break certani bedrocks that you misplaced, with just that pickaxe.

8 bedrocks that drop and an ancient debris, will craft into another bedrock pickaxe. You can't use regular bedrock, though.

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}Gametypes (oneblock, skyblock)&r</T>

We have global survival in /general and /wild, you can play /oneblock, /skyblock as well. Oh and we have /acid and /cave and /skygrid, and players in the builders group and up, will have access to creative plots in /builders.

It's possible to use the bottle of dragon breath on a special bedrock stone at /warp enchant to store your player exp into this bottoe. You can then later break that bottle to get that amount of exp back. Note, it's possible that after 1.19.1 in the future we remove this feature and let players store exp in the new sculk feature.

Players can always explore the /builders world, but only players in the group builder or higher can claim plots to play in.

Inventories can not and are not allowed to be shared between the builders world and the other worlds, custom items are not allwoed to be loaded in. Please note that upon any attempt (regardless of your rank) we will perm ban without option to appeal if we see ppl try to play unfair and abuse this creative privilege.

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}Soulbind on Armor and Items/Tools&r</T>

Through events and rewards only, it's possible players can obtain the ability to soulbind their armor, tools or items. These will not include blocks. It's up to the server owner who gets what and when, and on which item.

An item with soulbind will not disappear from your inventory when you die. Very handy for when you die in lava and respawn. You might lose your other items, but soulbound items will remain in the inventory.

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}Anti Grief / Region Claiming&r</T>

We do not tolerate grief, and will perm ban without option to appeal when we see significant abuse. 

We have the option to roll back most grief, so please do report it. 

If you're an active player with a base, feel free to request mrfloris via /mail to get the region protected. Include your xyz coordinates. You can also open a ticket on discord, which might be easier. 

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}Anti Grief / Item Protection (doors, chests)&r</T>

Use the /chests command to learn more about chest protection commands, but you can use /lock, and /unlock to manage your locked doors, trapdoors, hoppers, chests, barrels, etc. 

You play together with a trusted friend? Type /trust, and add them to your tem protections, they will then also gain access to those doors, chests, etc.

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}Jobs&r</T>

Players can join one or more jobs, jobs give player exp, jobs exp to level up the job, jobs points, which can be used in /jobs shop, and jobs money, which goes to your /money balance. 

To join a job type: /jobs browse, and carefully read the lore, it for example says right click to join.

You can leave a job, but it's possible you might lose a % of your gained levels. 

You can see the progress of your jobs with /jobs stats

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}mcMMO Levelling&r</T>

MMO levelling is for a dozen of skills, from mining, to smelting things in a furnace. You can see your stats with /mcstats, you can see your rank level with /mcrank and you can see the top 10 MMO players with /mctop.

Every skill listed in /mcstats is also a command with much more details, for example /mining and /woodcutting

You don't have to join a MMO skill, by playing you will automatically get these. 

Higher levels of skills give higher or longer or better perks, for example, even double drops while mining with a silk touch, or extra treasures while excavating sand. Extra strong hands to kill mobs in unarmred.

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}Greeting-points / Points Shop&r</T>

Each time a player joins you can greet them by their name, like 'hello player, welcome back!' They get a fuzzy feeling of being welcomed, and you can earn some greeting points. These points you can use in the /points shop, which give you items, commands, or trigger boosters.

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}Perm Worlds Information&r</T>

Check what you already have in /perk

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}Player versus Player Toggle (pvp)&r</T>

You can combat other players as well, it's off by defualt. 

Players who are in pvp mode will have red particles around their feet.

You can turn your pvp mode on with /pvp on
And off again with /pvp off

The general rule on the server is: if you die and others get your stuff, that's fair game. Unless you specifically agreed before the fight to return the items. 

Other players are not respoisnble for your armor or items breaking. 

<NextPage>
<T>{#Cerulean}Fishing Information&r</T>

We have over a 100 custom fish on the server, some only obtainable in certain biomes, others give custom commands. 

There is also pointy fish, you will recognize it by their name. You can eat those to get free /points 

Other fish without custom commands (but are custom fish) will heal you fully, great food resource!

All fish can be sold via /fish shop

At the moment you can get vanilla fish, fish treasure, fish crab, kill dolphins and squid to get special fish items, you can be a job fisherman, and level your mcmmo fisherman skill, and there's /fish as well, which is about the custom fishing. Yes, fishing is big on this server.

We also have fishing tournaments, keep your eyes open, sometimes the prizes are pretty wild.
