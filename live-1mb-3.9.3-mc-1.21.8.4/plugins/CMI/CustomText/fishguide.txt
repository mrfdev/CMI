There is also a really good thread that I took inspiration from, you should read it too!

<NextPage>
Let's start with the basics.

'/fish menu' will load the 1MB Fishing Menu with quick & easy access to the rest of the previously mentioned commands.

'/fish codex' shows a description of every special fish

'/fish sell' Here you can sell fish for money. 

Raw Fish* - $10

This menu will also show the "Special Fish" which can be sold for 1.5x it's base price. This changes every 6 hours.

'/fish scales' allows you to weigh your fish to increase profits. You can select different risk levels for even higher returns.

"What is Entropy?"

Entropy is the main custom currency used by the fish plugin. It's what's used when upgrading delivery upgrades, totem upgrades, or crafting augments.

You can earn Entropy from fishing, gutting, and doing deliveries.
<NextPage>
"How much Entropy do I get per catch?"

You get a set amount of base entropy when catching special fish:

Bronze - 30
Silver - 60
Gold - 100
Diamond - 200
Platinum - 550
Mythical - 750
<NextPage>
"How much plugin xp do I get per catch?"

Bronze - 30

Party Fishing:
You can also gain more entropy and xp by fishing within 30 blocks of other players. 5 players are required to get the max buff
\n[Fun Fact: You can Shift-Click your rod to open the '/fish menu']
<NextPage>
"What are the odds of catching a higher tier fish?"

Here's what the base odds are for each fish type:

Bronze - 60%
Silver - 15%
Gold - 5%
Diamond - 1%
Platinum - 0.2%
Mythical - 0.04%

'/fish deliveries' ??? 
~~~~~~~~~~~  
Deliveries are earned every 180 custom fish caught. 
Example Delivery: 
- 20x Bass; You must have 20x Bass in your inventory before starting the delivery.
Once the timer runs out, you click again to claim the reward!
<NextPage>
"How does Augment crafting work?"

- First, you need a Cauldron with water, and the exact amount of items required for the augment being crafted (including entropy and /fish lvl!) Throw all the items into the cauldron, and Shift-Click with your fishing rod.

Again, '/fish info' will have a lot of good info about this too, but this should be enough to get you started until you feel comfortable trying other things in the '/fish menu' 

You can also ask in chat, maybe someone online knows the answer! Best of luck!
<NextPage>
...and Happy Fishing :) 

P.S. Here's some bonus info I gathered:

SnowGlobe randomly creates globes of snow that when fished in will give the player more entropy and fishing xp. Higher the lvl, higher the bonus.
Works for those who fish inside of radius.
