I wonder what you are interested in %cmi_user_name%, maybe some wilderness survival, or some SkyBlock or a OneBlock challenges? 

We have a variety of game types. 

<NextPage>
You can type "/rtp" at spawn here, it will randomly teleport you somewhere into the /wild world. This is an almost vanilla wilderness where you can play, mine, build. Just respect the builds made by others (no grief).

If you want to play Skyblock, cave, acid, skygrid, or oneblock, just type: /skyblock, or /oneblock, .. and it will start your island. 
To learn how to team up with a friend, type /teams

Have fun! 

And thank you for not griefing and replanting! Stay safe.

Oh, you can type /warps, to see a menu with all the worlds.
