&b = Introduction
&bHey [playerName], this is a list of specialized commands from the CMI plugin. Specialized commands are special commands that allows certain actions to be performed, such as messaging the player or broadcasting a message to the entire server. This is made by Floris and MrCrazyMan02 for the 1MoreBlock.com server. But feel free to customize this to your liking. 

&3This is generally not a command for players really, it's more an internal command that helps the server owner with debugging things. So by default the custom alias you create should require a permission.

&3More information about CMI's specialized commands:&b https://www.zrips.net/cmi/commands/specialized/

&b = Usage
&bOnly one action variable should be used, otherwise the last one will be used.
&bSpecialized commands can be used in the following locations:
&3 * Ranks
&3 * Scheduler
&3 * Portals
&3 * Event Commands
&3 * Interactive Commands
&3 * Kits
&3 * Custom Alias

&b = General
<T>&3•msg!:&r msg!</T><H>msg!\n&bIf the command starts with msg! and a player name is given, a message will be sent to the player if they are online.\n&3Example:&f msg! Zrips Hello!</H><SC>msg! </SC>
<T>&3•broadcast!:&r broadcast!</T><H>broadcast!\n&bIf the command starts with broadcast!, the given message will be sent to all online players without any prefixes.</H><SC>broadcast! </SC>
<T>&3•actionbar!:&r actionbar!</T><H>actionbar!\n&bIf the command starts with actionbar!, the given message will be sent to all online players as an actionbar.</H><SC>actionbar! </SC>
<T>&3•title!:&r title!</T><H>title! \n&bIf the command starts with title!, the given message will be sent to all online players as a title.</H><SC>title! </SC>
<T>&3•subtitle!:&r subtitle!</T><H>subtitle!\n&bIf the command starts with subtitle!, the given message will be sent to all online players as a subtitle.</H><SC>%cmi_user_group%</SC>
<T>&3•kickall!:&r kickall!</T><H>kickall!\n&bIf the command starts with kickall!, all online players will be kicked from the server with the given message.</H><SC>kickall! </SC>
<T>&3•asPlayer!:&r asPlayer!</T><H>asPlayer!\n&bIf the command starts with asPlayer!, the given command will be performed as the player who sent the original initialising command.</H><SC>asPlayer! </SC>
<T>&3•asConsole!:&r asConsole!</T><H>asConsole!\n&bIf the command starts with asConsole!, the given command will be executed from the console. This can be used in areas such as custom aliases, which by default performs commands as the player if they haven't specifically been defined to be performed as the console.</H><SC>asConsole! </SC>
<T>&3•asFakeOp!:&r asFakeOp!</T><H>asFakeOp!\n&bIf the command starts with asFakeOp!, the given command will be performed as a player who has operator. This is slightly different from asConsole! because you will not receive any feedback message, and the server will process the command as if it was done by a real player. Keep in mind that this will perform the command as a completely different fake operator player.</H><SC>asFakeOp! </SC>
<T>&3•cooldown:[timeInSec]!:&r cooldown:[timeInSec]!</T><H>cooldown:[timeInSec]!\n&bIf the command starts with cooldown:[timeInSec]!, that line or any following lines (if defined) will have a cooldown before it can be used again.\n&3Example:&f cooldown:5! cmi heal [&fplayerName] - will heal the player, but can only be used every 5 seconds.</H><SC>cooldown:[timeInSec]! </SC>
<T>&3•ucooldown:[timeInSec]!:&r ucooldown:[timeInSec]!</T><H>ucooldown:[timeInSec]!\n&bIf the command starts with ucooldown:[timeInSec]!, the given command will have a cooldown applied depending on the source. This means that you can have different cooldowns depending on whether the command was triggered by a different interactive command or a different custom alias.</H><SC>ucooldown:[timeInSec]! </SC>
<T>&3•gcooldown:[timeInSec]!:&r gcooldown:[timeInSec]!</T><H>gcooldown:[timeInSec]!\n&bIf the command starts with gcooldown:[timeInSec]!, the given command will have a server wide cooldown applied to it. It is unable to be used by anyone if it was triggered by someone else and the cooldown has not ended.</H><SC>gcooldown:[timeInSec]! </SC>
<T>&3•perm:[permissionNode]!:&r perm:[permissionNode]!</T><H>perm:[permissionNode]!\n&bIf the command starts with perm:[permissionNode], the given command will only be performed if the player has the defined permission node. This will not work if we don't know who the target player is.\n&3Example:&f perm:cmi.announce.vip! broadcast! Hello VIP guys</H><SC>perm:[permissionNode]! </SC>
<T>&3•moneycost:[amount]!:&r moneycost:[amount]!</T><H>moneycost:[amount]!\n&bIf the command starts with moneycost:[amount]!, the given command will be performed if the player has enough money.</H><SC>moneycost:[amount]! </SC>

<T>&3•item:[itemdata](-amount)!:&r item:[itemdata](-amount)!</T><H>item:[itemdata](-amount)!\n&bIf the command starts with item:[itemdata](-amount)!, the given command will be performed if the player has enough items.\n&3Example:&f item:stone:1-12!&b will require 12 granite blocks for the command to be performed.</H><SC>item:[itemdata](-amount)! </SC>
<T>&3•hasitem:[itemdata](-amount)!:&r hasitem:[itemdata](-amount)!</T><H>hasitem:[itemdata](-amount)!\n&bIf the command starts with hasitem:[itemdata](-amount)!, the command will check if the player enough of the defined item.

The player will be informed if the requirement is not met.</H><SC>ifempty:[hand/offhand/quickbar/armor/inv/subinv]! </SC>
<T>&3•check:[value1][==|>|>=|<|<=|!=][value2][?][#]!:&r check:[value1][==|>|>=|<|<=|!=][value2][?][#]!</T><H>check:[value1][==|>|>=|<|<=|!=][value2][?][#]!\n&bIf the command starts with check:[value1][==|>|>=|<|<=|!=][value2][?][#]!, the given command will only be performed if the defined condition is met.\n&3Examples:\n&fcheck:%cmi_user_balance%>1000! - will only perform the command if the player's balance is greater than 1000.\n&fcheck:%cmi_user_name%==Zrips! - will only perform the command if the player's name is Zrips.</H><SC>check:[value1][==|>|>=|<|<=|!=][value2][?][#]! </SC>

<T>&3•delay! [timeInSec]:&r delay! [timeInSec]</T><H>delay! [timeInSec]\n&bIf a line contains delay! [timeInSec], the next commands will be performed after the given delay.\n&3Examples:\n&f- cmi launch [&fplayerName]\n&f- delay! 2\n&f- cmi launch [&fplayerName] - the previous 2 commands and this command will launch the player, wait 2 seconds, and then launch the player again.\n&f- cmi launch [&fplayerName]\n&f- delay! 2 playerlaunch\n&f- cmi launch [&fplayerName] - the previous 2 commands and this command will launch the player, define a delay of 2 seconds called playerlaunch, wait 2 seconds, and then launch the player again. This delay can be cancelled using canceldelay:[name]!. Defining a name for the delay is only available in CMI version 9.1.3.2 and above.</H><SC>delay! [timeInSec] </SC>
<T>&3•canceldelay:[name]!:&r canceldelay:[name]!</T><H>canceldelay:[name]!\n&bIf the command starts with canceldelay:[name], the defined delay name will be cancelled.</H><SC>canceldelay:[name]! </SC>

&b = Statements
<T>&3•statement:[value]!:&r statement:[value]!</T><H>statement:[value]!\n&bIf a line starts with statement:[value]!, the given conditions will be checked when the statement is called using the specialized command if:[value][@][#]!.\n&3Examples:\n&f- statement:check1! hasexp:50! hasmoney:100! perm:cmi.command.fly!\n&f- if:check1! msg! [playerName] PASS\n&f- if:check1@! msg! [playerName] FAIL - in this example, we have 3 checks on the first line, where the result is attached to the custom name, in this case check1, though you can name the check whatever you want. The next 2 lines utilize the results of the check, so the if:check1! line gets performed whenever the check returns true, while the if:check1@! gets performed whenever the check returns false. This allows you to perform checks once and then utilize the result for cleaner and faster command processing, so instead of repeating the same command checks, the results from the previous one will be utilized.\n&f- statement:check1! hasexp:50! hasmoney:100! perm:cmi.command.fly!\n&f- if:check1! command 1\n&f- if:check1! command 2\n&f- if:check1! command 3\n&f- if:check1! command 4\n&f- if:check1@! command 5\n&f- if:check1@! command 6\n&f- if:check1@! command 7</H><SC>statement:[value]! </SC>
